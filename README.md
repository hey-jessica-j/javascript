# javascript

Just needed a place to upload all my javascript practice projects

#buttons - wanted a starter project something simple. click a button change the background to that color. I want to expand this project to make it so I have one function for all colors. 
  ex. click a button "blue" attomatically enter that color from the text to the function and change it to that color.
  
#calculator - a working calculator project. Not working yet, but will be soon. Did HTML and CSS playing around in javascript to get it working.
