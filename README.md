# javascript

Just needed a place to upload all my javascript practice projects

#buttons - wanted a starter project something simple. click a button change the background to that color. I want to expand this project to make it so I have one function for all colors. 
  ex. click a button "blue" attomatically enter that color from the text to the function and change it to that color.
  
#buttons Revamped - made it so one function can be used regardless of the colors and the values can be changed without needed to edit much code in html, no changes to javascript or CSS. (future project - want to change it so that for each date shows a picture ex birthdays or milestones, or each letter makes a sound).
  
#calculator - a working calculator project. Not working yet, but will be soon. Did HTML and CSS playing around in javascript to get it working.
